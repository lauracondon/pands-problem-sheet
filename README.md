### Week 4 - collatz.py
10/02/2021 - Note: I'm not entirely happy with my solution, although it does work. I feel like there's probably an easier way to achieve the same outcome. In particular I'd like to go back and redo the way the program ends when the value becomes one as I feel I'm missing something obvious there!

 ### Week 6 - squareroot.py
 28/02/2021 - Note: I would like to go back and add some code that will restart the program if the user enters a negative number, rather than just throw an error message and end it
