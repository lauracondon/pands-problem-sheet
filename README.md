### Week 4 - collatz.py
10/02/2021 - Note: I'm not entirely happy with my solution, although it does work. I feel like there's probably an easier way to achieve the same outcome. In particular I'd like to go back and redo the way the program ends when the value becomes one as I feel I'm missing something obvious there!

 ### Week 6 - squareroot.py
 28/02/2021 - Note: I would like to go back and add some code that will restart the program if the user enters a negative number, rather than just throw an error message and end it

 ### Week 8 - plottask.py
10/03/2021 - Note: I need to comment my code and also add some extra formatting to it to make it look nicer

I used the tableau color blind 10 palette to choose colours for my lines. I converted them from rgb to hex for easier entry. In order to make it more obvious that the lines were overlapping I set two of them to be dashed in style, with different widths and distance between each dash.
